**About Me**
---
I am a second-year graduate student in the Artificial Intelligence track of the Electronic Information program at [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I completed my undergraduate studies at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/index.html). My research focuses on the design and control of cable-driven rigid robotic arms, encompassing hardware design, motion planning and control algorithms, and neural network learning. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xueqian Wang](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/wxq/list.htm) at the AI&ROBOT Laboratory, Tsinghua University.

You can find my CV here: [Luo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/resume_master.pdf).
